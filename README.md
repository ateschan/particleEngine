# ParticleEngine
I know it isn't much, but this is definietly one of the projects I had the most fun making

It's just a simple particle simulator


## Usage

Download and run with python3
You need pygame as a dependancy



## Controls

←↑→↓: Adjust velocity and direction of the paricles

Click: Spawns an explosion of particles

Space: Attaches/Unattaches the particles ot the cursor

1: "Vortex Mode" puts the particles into a state of orbital frenzy

2: Switches the color from a bland pink to a shifting rainbow 

C: Stands for collision. Activates an outer collision box for the window
